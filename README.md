## What is Bubble?
Instant messaging platforms are everywhere. And you’ve probably seen someone typing a message and wondered *“what are they typing?”*.

***Bubble*** is an instant messaging platform that actually enables **real-time** exchange of text messages. 

In other words, ***Bubble*** is all about **live texting**, reproducing a normal conversation in the online setting. 

The user will, therefore, see exactly what the response is, ever since the interlocutor types its first character.
